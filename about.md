# About Me

My name is David Pham, and I'm currently a third year student at the University of Toronto studying mathematics and statistics.

My hobbies include video games, cinematography/video editing and making people smile.

I also have a YouTube channel which you can check out [here.](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaaYCWSM01Ke6LqG100zg0A)

If anybody ever wondered what I listen to, follow me on [Spotify:](https://open.spotify.com/user/6r2g75pi5l7e863bglv83pzj9?si=CZbhiKIdRq2NqdZcS2SdHQ).  
I like listening to trap, rap and hip-hop, and I listen to k-pop every now and then.  
My favorite artists are Travis Scott, DaBaby and EXO (never forget).  
Favorite song: Magnolia by Playboi Carti. (Hide it in my sock)

It's truly a small, yet big world out there, folks. Enjoy the time we have.
