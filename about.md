# About Me

![image](/assets/images/cocosponsor.jpg){:height="384px" width="512px"}.

My name is David Pham, and I'm currently a third year student at the University of Toronto (St. George) studying mathematics and statistics.

My hobbies include video games, cinematography/video editing and making people smile.

I also have a YouTube channel which you can check out [here.](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaaYCWSM01Ke6LqG100zg0A)  
I haven't been posting because I'm very busy with school, but I hope to find the time to continue.  
You'll find that I upload all sorts of content, ranging from video games, educational videos, reviews to skits. It's a channel about me!

If anybody ever wondered what I listen to, follow me on [Spotify.](https://open.spotify.com/user/6r2g75pi5l7e863bglv83pzj9?si=CZbhiKIdRq2NqdZcS2SdHQ)  
I like listening to trap, rap and hip-hop, and I listen to k-pop every now and then.  
My favorite **artists** are Travis Scott, DaBaby and EXO (never forget).  
Favorite **song**: Magnolia by Playboi Carti.  
> In New York I Milly Rock (Rock)  
> Hide it in my sock (Sock)
