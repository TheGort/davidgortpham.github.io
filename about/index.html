My name is David Pham, and I'm currently a third year student at the University of Toronto studying mathematics and statistics.
My hobbies include video games, cinematography/video editing and making people smile.
I also have a YouTube channel which you can check out <a href"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaaYCWSM01Ke6LqG100zg0A">here</a>.
